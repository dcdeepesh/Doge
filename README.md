# Doge

[![Latest release badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/latest-v1.0-blue)](https://github.com/dcdeepesh/Doge/releases/latest)

A global overlay for Discord.

It's like the default Discord overlay, except that it's visible all the time, over any window (except games because you have the default overlay for that), and is also a bit more customizable.


## Download and Installation

Doge has been tested on 64-bit Windows 11, although it will work on other versions just fine. Download files can be found in the [latest release](https://github.com/dcdeepesh/Doge/releases/latest).

> Your browser, OS, antivirus etc. may warn you that Doge and/or its setup are harmful. This is just because the files are unsigned, those warnings can be safely ignored.


## Usage

Using Doge is simple, just start it from the desktop shortcut or the start menu entry (or set it to [run at startup](#run-at-startup) automatically), and you're good to go. Starting Doge will open the settings window by default, to assure you that it has started properly, as it takes a while to connect to your Discord client. This behaviour can be changed in the settings.

> The first time you use Doge, you have to connect it to your Discord client (a big flashy box will remind of this). **And don't forget to [whiltelist yourself](#whitelisting-yourself)!**


### Run at startup

By default, Doge does _not_ run at startup, because it's annoying to have apps automatically run at startup without you telling them to. But it is recommended to do so, as it saves you from the hassle of starting it every time you want to use it and improves user experience. To enable Doge to run at startup, go to it's settings and enable that option.

However, if you want to keep it disabled, you can start it from either the desktop shortcut or the start menu entry.


## Whitelisting yourself

There's a small catch when using Doge. Because of how Discord's security features work, even if you connect Doge to your Discord client, it won't work until I whitelist you myself. Hopefully this will change in the future and manual whitelisting won't be necessary (efforts are being put to achieve this).

Until then, [contact me](#contact-and-support) with your Discord username and discriminator (e.g. `Dummy#1254`; `<username>#<discriminator>`), and tell me that you want to be whitelisted, and unless I have an ongoing feud with you, you'll be whitelisted (typically within a few minutes unless I'm sleeping).


## Contact and support

If you've found a bug, want to request a feature, request whitelisting,have a suggestion or have any other questions, you can contact me on Discord (`Krove#5477`), [email me](mailto:dcdeepesh7@gmail.com), or open an issue on GitHub.
